<h1 align="center"> A Modular and Scalable Pipeline for Microbiome Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics Data Integration </h1>

MIntO (Microbiome Integrated Meta-Omics), is a **highly versatile pipeline** that integrates metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data in a scalable way.
The distinctive feature of this pipeline is the computation of gene expression profile by taking into account the community turnover and gene expression variations as the underlying process that shapes the community transcript levels along the time and between conditions.
The integrated pipeline will be relevant to provide unique biochemical insights into the microbial ecology by linking functions to retrieved genomes and to examine gene expression variations.

## What should I know about MIntO?
There is a lot of code behind MIntO (it really does a lot of stuff!), but do not be scared about it... everyone can use it! 
We provide all the key steps and necessary explanations in the [wiki section](https://github.com/arumugamlab/MIntO/wiki/). 
We suggest to read the **[MIntO in a nutshell](https://github.com/arumugamlab/MIntO/wiki/MIntO-in-a-nutshell)** section first, just to have an idea on how MIntO works. 
Then move to the **[Installation&Dependencies](https://github.com/arumugamlab/MIntO/wiki/Installation&Dependencies)** and then you are set to discover each step! 
Also you can have a look to the **tutorial** [here](https://github.com/arumugamlab/MIntO/wiki/MIntO-tutorial)! :)
