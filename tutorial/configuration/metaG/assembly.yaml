# MEGAHIT settings

# Total used memory is not given here but calculated to be 10G per sample in the coassembly.
# Default parameter is 5 for metaG samples with 10M reads.
# Please make sure that there is enough RAM on the server.

# MetaFlye settings
#
# MetaFlye will be run for each parameter preset listed here.
# By default Flye will be run with these parameters:
#    --meta --genome-size 3.0m
# If you need to add more options, define them here and name them for future reference.
# Notes:
# ------
# 1. Each preset parameter will be applied to each sample. If you only
#    want one parameter to be used, please comment everything else.
# 2. If nothing is listed here, then MetaFlye won't be run.
#    If you just want our default parameters above, then here is a possible option:
#      metaflye-default: 
# 3. 'tres-o3000-3x' is valid for flye 2.8.3. From 2.9.x, --plasmids and --trestle are
#    not valid. So please use valid options if you are using newer versions of flye.

# Input data

# HYBRID section:
# ---------------
# MetaSPAdes hybrid assembly will be performed using these definitions.
# Definition format:
#   Each nanopore sample is in the LHS, and corresponding illumina sample(s) are in RHS (delimited by '+').
#   Hybrid assemblies will be performed for each combination of nanopore and illumina samples.
#   E.g.:
#
#   N1: I3+I4 
#
#   The above will result in 2 hybrid assemblies: 'N1-I3' and 'N1-I4'
#
#   This definition was designed based on our practice of pooling multiple samples derived from the same
#   donor for nanopore sequencing to strike a balance between price and sensitivity. If your nanopore samples
#   are paired one-to-one with illumina samples, then the definition gets simpler.
#   E.g.:
#
#   N1: I3
#   N2: I4
#
#   The above will result in 2 hybrid assemblies: 'N1-I3' and 'N2-I4'

# COASSEMBLY section:
# -------------------
# MEGAHIT coassembly will be performed using the following definitions.
# Each coassembly is named in the LHS, and corresponding illumina sample(s) are in RHS (delimited by '+').
# One coassembly will be performed for each line. 
# E.g. 'Subject1: I3+I4' will result in 1 coassembly: 'Subject1' using I3 and I4 data.
# Memory per coassembly is calculated to be 10G per sample in the coassembly.
# Please make sure that there is enough RAM on the server.
